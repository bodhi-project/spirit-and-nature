* One is the pure -white- world, where one can always come back to rest.
* One is the place of the hero. He fights the dragon and the phoenix and think he is right. But actually he is not seeing the whole picture, he does not know that the dragon and the phoenix guards their precious egg.
* One is the place where people are happily working. Each is doing what he/she likes, even if one task is harder than the other, it does not matter, no-one compares.
* One is the place where many mysteries are still to be uncovered.
