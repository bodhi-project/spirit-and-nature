# Vision Game

> _Why are we here in this Universe, on this Earth?_
> _A question to which many answers were given..._
> _But for each of us, what does it mean?_

_Which world does my heart yearn for, which secret- sacred gift do I carry?_
_Finding the answer is like praying…entering a state of receptivity._

_ Look far in front…Your life is your canvas, what do you paint on it?_
_ Sink into the deep landscape of your heart and let it lead you…_

- It is about coming in touch or having glimpses of that part in ourselves which knows what to do.
- It is about following our deeper dreams and building a life of wonder.

We recently came together with a few people, each made their world. Find here what some say about it:

## Testimony, A.

_'I learned a lot. I learned to reflect on myself and to give a meaning to the actions I do. Because sometimes I tend to do actions not knowing why. I learned to go deeper and look at the past and the future at the same time. It was a brightening experience to be able to see what you’re up to and what you need and are.'_

The importance of bees and lions!

‘the Ganesh in our house remembered me always of India and finally I came here…’

‘How wonderful it would be to have a world where money is not the sovereign Lord, and so it get dugged under the sand as something from the past.’

_'We did a short vision game (1/2day) and for me that was a first introduction. I really liked it. Aikya is very well equipped for this and she has lots of material. It was nice to feel like a child again and explore and go with the flow. Thanks Aikya for introducing me to vision games! 😍'_

_'I realized half through setting up the vision game, that I was basically now working on living that dream! On changing my life into what I was setting up.'_

_'I was surprised how instantaneous my concentration was, even though my work requires a lot of concentration every day, it seems that at that moment I really needed this kind of outlet for my imagination, it felt like some kind of release. The whole thing continued afterwards, even though I don’t remember my dreams I know that some of these figures came alive in my dreams. As a result, the next few days were about integrating the new information into the work I’m doing with Mother’s symbol.'_

## K.’s deep felt creation

If you would like to make a vision game with a little group, contact me.

For the moment I take up to 6 people and minimum 3.

½ day short version or full day long version.
