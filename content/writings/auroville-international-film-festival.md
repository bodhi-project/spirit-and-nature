Five movies were made for the ‘One United Roar’ International talent challenge by Aurovilian TLC kids and were recently submitted to the [Auroville International Film Festival](http://filmfestival.auroville.org/). Yam’s movie won the _Wisdom Award_. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcNM4GcM3ts).

Jury: “_This film is a mature attempt to bring our attention to the beauty that surrounds us which we take for granted. The film urges us to be a part of such activity which will nurture human understanding about our world exponentially. The film also makes a poignant statement about the danger of losing the nature and beauty around us, if we do not appreciate and act to preserve them._”

Also was submitted the movie clip called ‘A Dream Comes True’. You can also see this movie [here](/white-lions#a-dream-comes-true).
