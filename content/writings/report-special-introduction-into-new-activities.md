## Report - Special Introduction Into New Activities

In the month of April we launched a series of new activities at our Learning Center.

These activities are a prelude of what will come during the next months. 

We have many ideas.

The topics arouse quite some interest and the gatherings were well attended despite the upcoming summer heat.

Here some pictures.
