# Auroville

Auroville (City of Dawn) is an experimental township in Viluppuram district mostly in the state of Tamil Nadu, India with some parts in the Union Territory of Puducherry in South India. It was founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (known as "the Mother").

Stated in The Mother's first public message in 1965, "Auroville wants to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realize human unity."

The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity in diversity. Auroville is recognised as the first and only internationally endorsed ongoing experiment in human unity and transformation of consciousness, also concerned with - and practically researching into - sustainable living and the future cultural, environmental, social and spiritual needs of mankind.

Residents of Auroville come from some 49 nations, from all age groups (from infancy to over eighty, averaging around 30), from all social classes, backgrounds and cultures, representing humanity as a whole. The population of the township is constantly growing, but currently stands at around 2,500 people, of whom approx one-third are Indian.

# The Mother and her vision for Auroville

Auroville was founded by Mirra Alfasa, known as The Mother. She was the spiritual collaborator of Sri Aurobindo, the great Indian visionary and yogi who evolved a new method of spiritual practice, which he called Integral Yoga. 

Auroville is a laboratory for the materialization of a new consciousness. Every one is welcome who has good will and believes Human Unity is possible and aspires for it. 

Mother’s vision for Auroville began to take shape on that same day in 1968 when an inauguration ceremony took place on a piece of bare ground north of Pondicherry; she read the “Auroville Charter” from her room in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. 

“A Dream” is another marvelous writing by the Mother describing a place on earth where human beings obey only the supreme Truth. This Dream of the Divine has drawn and continues to draw many people to Auroville. It touches upon deep aspirations and gives faith for a bright future. 

# Auroville Charter

1. Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity as a whole. But to live in Auroville, one must be a willing servitor of the Divine Consciousness. 
2. Auroville will be the place of an unending education, of constant progress, and a youth that never ages. 
3. Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Auroville will boldly spring towards future realizations. 
4. Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual Human Unity.
