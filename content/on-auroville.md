# Auroville

Auroville was founded by Mirra Alfasa, known as The Mother. She was the spiritual collaborator of Sri Aurobindo, the great Indian visionary and yogi who evolved a new method of spiritual practice, which he called Integral Yoga.

Auroville is a laboratory for the materialization of a new consciousness. Every one is welcome who has good will and believes Human Unity is possible and aspires for it.

On the 28 th of February 1968 The Mother stated, “Auroville wants to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realize human unity”.

Mother’s vision for Auroville began to take shape on that same day in 1968 when an inauguration ceremony took place on a piece of bare ground north of Pondicherry; she read the “Auroville Charter”1 from her room in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity in diversity. Auroville is recognised as the first and only internationally endorsed ongoing experiment in human unity and transformation of consciousness, also concerned with - and practically researching into - sustainable living and the future cultural, environmental, social and spiritual needs of mankind.

Residents of Auroville come from some 49 nations, from all age groups (from infancy to over eighty, averaging around 30), from all social classes, backgrounds and cultures, representing humanity as a whole. The population of the township is constantly growing, but currently stands at around 2,500 people, of whom approx one-third are Indian.

“A Dream” is another marvelous writing by the Mother describing a place on earth where human beings obey only the supreme Truth. This Dream of the Divine has drawn and continues to draw many people to Auroville. It touches upon deep aspirations and gives faith for a bright future.

There should be somewhere on earth a place which no nation could claim as its own, where all human beings of goodwill who have a sincere aspiration could live freely as citizens of the world and obey one single authority, that of the supreme Truth; a place of peace, concord and harmony where all the  ghting instincts of man would be used exclusively to conquer the causes of his su erings and miseries, to surmount his weak- nesses and ignorance, to triumph over his limitations and incapacities; a place where the needs of the spirit and the concern for progress would take precedence over the satisfaction of desires and passions, the search for pleasure and material enjoyment.

In this place, children would be able to grow and develop integrally without losing contact with their souls; education would be given not for passing examinations or obtaining certificates and posts but to enrich existing faculties and bring forth new ones. In this place, titles and positions would be replaced by opportunities to serve and organise; the bodily needs of each one would be equally provided for, and intellectual, moral and spiritual superiority would be expressed in the general organisation not by an increase in the pleasures and powers of life but by increased duties and responsibilities.

Beauty in all its artistic forms, painting, sculpture, music, literature, would be equally accessible to all; the ability to share in the joy it brings would be limited only by the capacities of each one and not by social or financial position.

For in this ideal place money would no longer be the sovereign lord; individual worth would have a far greater importance than that of material wealth and social standing. There, work would not be a way to earn one’s living but a way to express oneself and to develop one’s capacities and possibilities while being of service to the community as a whole, which, for its own part, would provide for each individual’s subsistence and sphere of action.

In short, it would be a place where human relationships, which are normally based almost exclusively on competition and strife, would be replaced by relationships of emulation in doing well, of collaboration and real brotherhood.

Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity as a whole. But to live in Auroville, one must be a willing servitor of the Divine Consciousness. 

Auroville will be the place of an unending education, of constant progress, and a youth that never ages. 

Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Auroville will boldly spring towards future realizations. 

Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual Human Unity.
