# Magical Expressions

Magical elements like fairies, dragons,  rebirds, magic crystals, spells are a common characteristic of this age group.

Fairy stories are de nitely, one of the favorite topics for 8 to 10-year old girls. I enjoyed listening to endless fairy stories.

This is one from Sita: “The green fairy has lived happily some one million years without being married, which is nice because nobody is bossing her around, and she does not need to clean the house, but now she wants to marry and who to marry is the question. She has to travel to a place where magic sand is kept in sacks, with a special shield, which would dissolve the cover (represented by a paper napkin with hearts) where the treasure is kept. This treasure is a crown, and there is also a magic ball coming from the good gods who will say which prince to marry ... “

Sunanda Poddar, who is the Caretaker of “Srismriti”, The Mother’s Museum in Pondicherry, tells us:

I still see this world of fairies. They are the same entities as ‘devas’. They still come to me although I am practicing yoga. Now there is more meaning in them for me. I see them as spirits of the vegetable kingdom — not just as playmates any more. Not only did this world of fairies increase through the Mother but a whole world of beauty, re nement and the realization of her perfection in works was shown. Now I call them ‘beings’ — overseers of the vegetal kingdom.

Madu had disturbed a little arrangement in the box by adding something and Laya complained lightly. Madu laughed and said: “It is not me, it is the fairy.” Then she said: “You know, some people believe their toys are alive.” I said, “Yes, it looks like that, doesn’t it?” Then she tells me about her father’s doll which is always next to her bed, and when she cries the doll is there next to her bed to help her. Then she asks Laya (7 years old) if she believes in fairies. Laya says “Yes, and you?” Madu (almost 9 years old) answers: “Before I believed, but now ...”

Madu seemed to be in transition between believing in magic, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and the phase where the mental takes over.

In the introduction of his book, “Enchantment of the Faerie Realm”, 1996, Ted Andrews says:

When we were children, we knew everything had its own life and energy. The distance between our world and that which we now call ‘imaginary’ was no further than our closet or backyard. Every blade of grass and every  ower had a story to tell. The winds whispered in our ears. Shadows had life, and woods were much more than trees. In our search for the modern life, we no longer see with a child’s eyes, and we sco  and laugh at those who do. In a world of technology and modern conveniences, we have grown insensitive to the nuances of nature. We built boundaries around our lives and shield ourselves from that which we do not understand. Though our lives may seem more safe and secure, they have also lost much wonder and joy.

This feeling that every thing has its own life, seems a very important quality that should be cherished and encouraged. In a world which loses contact with real life, and escapes more and more into virtuality, knowing that a tree is alive and sensitive, that an animal feels and can be happy or sad, that a stone is alive and has a memory, that an object can talk to people and have preferences in how it is handled or where it is disposed, that one can call the rain or ask the rain not to come, that one can send prayers with the birds, is essential to reconnect and save our planet and ourselves from destruction. This can help us grow into a unitive feeling, the One in the all, and the all in the One, into a communion and a truer communication.

# Psychic Expressions

"We give the name ‘psychic’ to the psychological center of our being, the seat within us of the highest truth of our existence, that which can know this truth and set it in movement." - The Mother, “CWM”, Vol 2, p. 12:4

It is beautiful to see the world with the innocence of children, to see the purity of children. Small children often have their psychic more in front, they are more receptive.

Although the World Game relates to all planes of the being, it can especially be a good opportunity to invite and bring forward touches of the psychic dimension. When the mind develops, children can loose this spontaneous receptivity, the innocence.

An environment in which the psychic gets evoked, can help the children to remember their connection to beauty and love.

Many human beings in the world think they know everything, but this world is also like a game, a theater play. The true world is beyond and behind the appearances and not manifested yet.

The Divine has set an evolving play in movement and directs its unfolding for the joy of becoming and progressing eternally.

Here, in Auroville, our game is to build a city with a living soul. The psychic is the secret source of beauty and love.

And in the World Game the children create worlds with endless possibilities, eventually learning to build worlds with harmony, beauty and poetry.

"If you have an artistic or poetic consciousness, if you love harmony, beauty, you will build there something marvelous which will tend to spring up into the material manifestation." - The Mother

All children, wherever they are born, come with a gift which is the purpose of their life and will be revealed.
