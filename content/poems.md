## Approaching Creation

_my heart beating fast, my heart bursting out,_  
_my heart coming to life,_  
_my heart stretching out to give, my heart remembering far away,_  
_my heart touched by deep tenderness and love,_  
_my heart sighs, my heart fears not, my heart knows the way now,_  
_my heart may cry by times, but is not closed,_  
&nbsp;  
_flying above the ocean, the fish knowing its deep waters,_
_flying with the moon and giving a hug to a known or unknown friend,_
_flying through the galaxy, finding source and being all, Gaia,_
_flying in my dreams and remembering belonging to all, to you Mother,_
_flying to exhaustion and always flying again, wings growing stronger day by day,_
_flying through the night waiting for the Sun to rise,_
 
_When, where, how...?_

## Born

_moving between past, future and present,_  
_alternating joy, pain and silence,_  
_between patience and longing and being,_  
_who am i, what is going to happen, what is happening?_  
_all is me..._  
_imaginations, visions, nothing,_  
_words, feelings, pieces of reality,_  
_i explode, implode,_  
_reborn, reborn, reborn..._  
_with bliss and spasm,_  
_with myself, and others..._  
_alive i am this i know_  

## Sunmaned

_sunmaned,_  
_starring eyes,_  
_playful heaven of love,_  
_white light_  
_blue peace_  

_unperturbed you walk_  
_King_  
_with the scars of little life_  
_on Your noble face_  
_secure in the presence of Grace_  

_high fences_  
_electric guardians_  
_against coward head hunters-lost_  

_oh Gods and Goddesses to BE_  
_now is the time to reverse and soar_  
_and roar lion, roar lions_  
_till the night surrenders into ever-lasting days_  

_enveloped in the blanket of my dreams_  
_i watch the world through your eyes_  
_my heart weeps_  
_with a new strength_  
_of rainbow colors_
