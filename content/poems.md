![Poem #3](/content-assets/poems/poem3_900X900.jpg)

_My heart beating fast, my heart bursting out,_  
_My heart coming to life,_  
_My heart stretching out to give, my heart remembering far away,_  
_My heart touched by deep tenderness and love,_  
_My heart sighs, my heart fears not, my heart knows the way now,_  
_My heart may cry by times, but is not closed,_  
&nbsp;  
_Flying above the ocean, the fish knowing its deep waters,_
_Flying with the moon and giving a hug to a known or unknown friend,_
_Flying through the galaxy, finding source and being all, Gaia,_
_Flying in my dreams and remembering belonging to all, to you Mother,_
_Flying to exhaustion and always flying again, wings growing stronger day by day,_
_Flying through the night waiting for the Sun to rise,_
 
_When, where, how...?_

_Moving between past, future and present,_  
_Alternating joy, pain and silence,_  
_Between patience and longing and being,_  
_Who am i, what is going to happen, what is happening?_  
_All is me..._  
_Imaginations, visions, nothing,_  
_Words, feelings, pieces of reality,_  
_I explode, implode,_  
_Reborn, reborn, reborn..._  
_With bliss and spasm,_  
_With myself, and others..._  
_Alive i am this i know_
