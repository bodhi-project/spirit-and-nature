# Approaching Creation

![Poem #3](/content-assets/poems/poem3_900X900.jpg)

_My heart beating fast, my heart bursting out,_  
_My heart coming to life,_  
_My heart stretching out to give, my heart remembering far away,_  
_My heart touched by deep tenderness and love,_  
_My heart sighs, my heart fears not, my heart knows the way now,_  
_My heart may cry by times, but is not closed,_  
&nbsp;  
_Flying above the ocean, the fish knowing its deep waters,_
_Flying with the moon and giving a hug to a known or unknown friend,_
_Flying through the galaxy, finding source and being all, Gaia,_
_Flying in my dreams and remembering belonging to all, to you Mother,_
_Flying to exhaustion and always flying again, wings growing stronger day by day,_
_Flying through the night waiting for the Sun to rise,_
 
_When, where, how...?_

_Moving between past, future and present,_  
_Alternating joy, pain and silence,_  
_Between patience and longing and being,_  
_Who am i, what is going to happen, what is happening?_  
_All is me..._  
_Imaginations, visions, nothing,_  
_Words, feelings, pieces of reality,_  
_I explode, implode,_  
_Reborn, reborn, reborn..._  
_With bliss and spasm,_  
_With myself, and others..._  
_Alive i am this i know_  

# Sunmaned

_Sunmaned,_  
_starring eyes,_  
_playful heaven of love,_  
_white light_  
_blue peace_  

_Unperturbed you walk_  
_King_  
_With the scars of little life_  
_on Your noble face_  
_Secure in the presence of Grace_  

_High fences_  
_Electric guardians_  
_Against coward head hunters-lost_  

_Oh god(esse)s to BE_  
_Now is the time to reverse and soar_  
_And roar lion, roar lions_  
_Till the night surrenders into ever-lasting das_  

_Enveloped in the blanket of my dreams_  
_I watch the world through your eyes_  
_My heart weeps_  
_with a new strength_  
_of rainbow colors_
