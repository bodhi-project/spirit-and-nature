# Satyavan

Satyavan, born September 2003, is a French-Haitian and in 2007 he was the youngest of my regular players. An absolutely delightful, lively, little boy, making very elaborate stories mixing nature, magic and civilisation.

He thoroughly identified with what he did and exclaimed how he just wanted to jump into the World in the box.

# Jasmine

Jasmine, born March 2002, is Indian-British and began to attend the World Game in 2009. She often likes to come alone, although she can make very interesting creations with friends. She is naturally quiet, sweet and happy. Jasmine is very creative, she handles things carefully and she is precise. There is often an underlying structure in her creations, such as a mandala or a city. Her creations express harmony and endlessly sweet details, a play of paradise. Jasmine is particularly special to me because of her beautiful presence.

Jasmine’s cat died and in her play the cat appeared in the middle of the box. It was a way of honouring and saying goodbye to her good friend. During this period the cat was always present in her creations. One day Jasmine came with her friend Elisa; so harmoniously they created an hour and a half game without uttering one word. Jasmine appears again with her good friend Zohar in the Stories.

# Zohar

Zohar, born June 2003, is a South African-Israeli and he started coming to the World Games during the school year in 2010. He was then 7 years old. Before he became interested in the World Game we went on a trip every week and through the contact with plants and animals, especially birds and chickens, we grew close to one another. Doing the World Game was a challenge for him. In the beginning he was not very interested in any of the objects; he preferred to go into the garden. We had to talk a lot before he would begin; he always loved to tell all kinds of incredible stories and sometimes I had to ask him whether he was in “this” world or “that” one. Physically he did not move about much in the room, he just grabbed things closest to him or simply asked me for a specialc object. It is also typical for Zohar to repeat some words in a funny way or just make strange, unrelated sounds such as di-di-di-di or la-la-la-la.

Zohar is special for me due to our particular connection. He is not a child who connects to the World Game spontaneously but evolves with it in his own way.

![Zohar #2](/content-assets/children-of-world-games/zohar2.jpg)

In January 2011 his little sister was born; when I asked about So a, he remained silent. I took small babies out of a box to show him. He took the babies and started to make an interesting scene with a cooking pot and stove, making soup with the babies, with a crystal gravy. Then he would hide a baby in the sand so that he could not see it nor could the parents find it. It was important for him to work out his feelings. The World Game gave him a way to express those feelings.

One day in January 2012, Zohar (8 years) came with his good friend Zea (11years). Although the elder she is always very loving. That day I had put on some music with the sounds of dolphins, because they were using a dolphin in their World Game. I said, “Listen, the dolphin is saying something!” pointing at the dolphin in the container. Zea knew I was joking, but Zohar totally believed it and stared at the dolphin with marvel. The biggest marvel for me was that this went on for 5 minutes until we told him that the sound came from the music. Zohar has a very sweet character; he took it with ease and a smile.

Another time Zohar came with Jalin and they initiated a new way of doing the World Game, partially in the water. They both left the box and the room, and went on the verandah to the pond, took boats and people and started to play their game here. That was fun for Zohar!

In another session with Jalin, there was a struggle over issues. Jalin does not want to use anything which does not look real and certainly not any play mobil1. Zohar could not enter the game. Finally with a small intervention on my part, they decided to be friends but not to do the World Game together next time. They continued the session harmoniously making some compromises for this time.

In the Stories you can read about Zohar’s collaboration with Jasmine.

# Sita

Sita, born January 2006, is Chinese and started coming to me in 2012 and wants to come every week, sometimes alone, sometimes with a friend. She loves to make stories, so her world evolves during the time she is there. Her imagination is so vivid; she can build special atmospheres. In the beginning she regularly broke things, as she is very passionate. Later she learned to handle objects more carefully. Sita totally lives in the moment, and after a fight depicted in the sandbox she sighs deeply, as if she is tired.

Sita’s stories are almost always with fairies, queens, and sometimes battles (often in the form of humans who attack the magical world with their weapons) some people die, but continue living elsewhere in a kind of heaven, where one can visit them. Sita also sometimes shares about her inner life or asks questions.

“Sita is really my most regular creator for a while now. A sweet relationship is building. Recently she told me (through her stories) how one day when she had just arrived in Auroville, she had an extraordinary 10 second experience in which she saw the walls of the room (in the house where she lived) covered with a pinkish new type of “dust”. It was like ‘rain on the walls’. It was my turn to share a special experience: once on the 29th of February there were a few seconds where I saw the trees covered in golden powder.” — Journal

Sita represents for me a very lively child who really loves the World Game, and has many magical stories -

“Once upon a time there is a palace, you can see paper screens to make the walls, the entry, tall pieces of wood, cut into slices which are the birthplaces of fairies, there are trees, crystals, Pegasus.... it makes me think of a Chinese landscape. When the fairies are born they are surrounded by crystals and each one has a name, such as Jasmine, Sarah, or Rose. One fairy became a queen. She received a special jewel from the time when the world was born, and all the magic of the fairies is in that jewel. Babies were born, also a baby unicorn, ‘baddies’ came, a house was built..."

Sita always had ‘baddies’ in her stories, but one can observe how the play evolves over time. The ba les became smaller, less important, sometimes baddies disappeared towards the end. She even wants more place for the ‘goodies’ physically in the box. She also insists that her friend Madu (almost 1 year older) would be on her side and they would then play against baddies together.

Sita often came with Madu. They loved to make parallel worlds in which they are two sisters who each have “the most extra ordinary worlds” and visit each other. Another time Veerle joined them (see photo).

Another time the girls play together versus a boy. The girls are in the fairy world while the boy is in the human world, with weapons. At the end there is an a empt to make peace, but the discussion is still going on when the time ends.

Sita mostly chooses the same green fairy to represent who she is. This seems very important for her. Some children actually choose a particular object over and over again to role-play who they are.

# Veerle

Here is Veerle, born January 2003, is Dutch and  came to me for a period of 3 years. The first 2 years it seemed very important to her. She was always joyful and almost a little over-active. She talked a lot, and she found it difficult to stop the play when it was time to go home. She needed to interact with me, as well. Sometimes I had the feeling that she hid her feelings behind the endless stories.

She liked to come alone. She liked to sing. Later she would often come with friends and had a balanced way of proceeding. Then her topics went in the direction of young girls in love, with lots of giggling. She has a very vivid imagination. The little figures speak with her and many stories arise. Often with fairies, a castle, a witch, dwarves, dolphins, crystals.

![Veerle](/content-assets/children-of-world-games/veerle.jpg)

I heard that during her time in Kindergarden she wasn’t very interested in building with wooden blocks, probably she needed more concrete figures.

One day Veerle brought her own camera and wanted to make a structured story from beginning to end which was a change, as often her stories rambled from one thing to another. Veerle has a way of handling things which is very connected to the objects themselves; I find it pleasant to watch. Sometimes she disappears a little into herself or into the things or, she just starts exploring something like rolling cars. When working with another child like Madu (2 years younger) it would stimulate her to be more concentrated. Madu would tell her: “Veerle, we have not much time, let’s go on ...” Veerle goes into smelling small perfume bottles and enjoying the sensation, and here again Madu reminds her to go on.

One day Veerle and Eden (same age) had a serious thought during the days before their appointment for the World Game, and I was not sure Veerle would show up. Her mother shared her concern. I assured her that I was there and that it might be a good way to make peace. They did come together and made a harmonious sandbox with one part a crystal garden guarded by dinosaurs and one with little people in a city.
