This book is done as a sketch with spontaneous sparks of Wonder. The World Game gives the children an opportunity to be creative, to be able to express their own individuality and unique living soul. It is an invitation to believe in the future and create a new world.

The World Game, also known as Sandplay, is an educational tool used in Auroville since the late 1960s whereby children can creatively explore their thoughts, feelings, and imagination in an effort "to know oneself", a core principle of learning. In this book the author describes her approach to using the World Game in Auroville. 

Children are given a box of sand and free access to unusual and appealing objects. Music, flowering gardens, paintings, and the quietly observant presence of the facilitator contribute to creating a concentrated atmosphere in which the child can tell his story or express her dreams. The book includes quotations from Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, pictures of the children and their creations, their individual stories, and guiding steps for implementing the World Game.
