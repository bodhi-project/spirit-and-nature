The World Game, also known as Sandplay, is an educational tool used in Auroville since the late 1960s whereby children can creatively explore their thoughts, feelings, and imagination in an effort "to know oneself", a core principle of learning. In this book Aikya describes her approach to using the World Game in Auroville.

This book is done as a sketch with spontaneous sparks of Wonder. The World Game gives the children an opportunity to be creative, to be able to express their own individuality and unique living soul. It is an invitation to believe in the future and create a new world.
