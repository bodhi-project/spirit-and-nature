# White Lions and Evolutionary Astrology

Maurice is an inspired Evolutionary Astrology counsellor and teacher, currently based in the United States. He has a long relation with the White Lions and is part of the Faculty of the Academy of LionHearted Leadership. This is where I met Maurice last year. The togetherness was a concentrated presence, sharing connections with Nature spirit.

The topic was: _The White Lions of Timbavati, messengers from the Stars._ It was a special occasion to know first hand about the White Lions and about this unique Conservation and Leadership project and enjoy a moment in the forest garden!

Nature is such a special gift of the divine spirit to have around. It brings us back to the simple beauty of existence which is nowadays often forgotten.

The love for nature we all have was tangible.

Khusum Dhar Prabhu, Jungian analyst based in Bangalore was also present. She was an assisting teacher for the ‘White Lion Dreaming’ module during the last Academy. She related her powerful experience encountering the Lions.

We are so fortunate to live in Auroville, a place on earth which aspires for Human Unity including the multidimensional way of existence.

Maurice also shared some astrology with the kids.

In his words:

_"Introducing the incredibly wise kids of Auroville to astrology was lots of fun (and not so obvious)... so, not making this up: the Pisces wants to be a diver, the Taurus wants to be a baker, the Aquarian wants to be an actor or a scientist of space, the other Aquarian wants to be a computer You-Tube gamer, the Cancer wants to be a chef, the Sag wants to be a scientist to save the planet... There ya go!  Ready now for the year of the Dog!"_

Kids enjoyed!

It is important to remember that the universe is alive and changes positions all the time. Each planet being a living entity with it's precise influence. Although one has to be genius to know the whole picture, it is fun to start to make connections and remember the beauty of the universe.... - well worth the learning !
