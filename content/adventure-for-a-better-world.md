[One United Roar](https://www.oneunitedroar.org/) is an international talent challenge for youth. 12 children from Auroville participated in August 2016, you can read about it [here](/reconnecting-with-spirit-through-nature#one-united-roar). Asia and Yam were two of the international winners and in March 2017 they had the opportunity to visit the White Lions in South Africa for one week.
