# Nature

Natural elements such as trees, gardens, jungles, the sea, beaches, deserts, rivers, stones, plus a variety of animals all seem to have a large place in the children’s creations. 

The natural world is of particular interest to this age group (4 to 11 years), as children are just coming into an extended consciousness of the world whether they are exposed to a lot of nature or not. One tree in the city or a pet mouse can be as appealing as a forest and a farmyard to an individual child. Here in Auroville we are fortunate enough to have an abundance of nature and animals. 

It is rare to have a World Game where none of these elements are present. Sometime, mostly among the boys, one observes a solely technical world.

# Civilisation

The next element which we find frequently in the creations are elements of civilisation in the form of houses, cities, villages, farms, castles, fences, people, vehicles, tunnels. Not surprisingly, boats, trains, planes and cars are frequently used by boys.

Pathways come up regularly in differing creative ways: sometimes white marble blocks are used, sometimes glass stones, sometimes a feather, sometimes a large piece of wood. Sometimes a ladder is used to go from one sand tray to another one.

Food items are very often present, too. In the beginning I did not have many things representing food. Once I had a child who simply asked for a fresh carrot and then cut it in small pieces, making tiny carrots. Another time a child wrote on a paper: bread, fruits, etc. Now I have some tasty looking miniature pizza and cakes. Restaurants or picnics can appear and all kind of shops, or shows such as a choir or a circus. The children love perfumes. They often smell deeply into the bottles and some sprinkle it on their hands, or even mix it in the sand. One boy systematically smells the bottles every time he comes.

Objects characteristic of particular ancient civilisations are greatly appreciated. Having traveled to Egypt, I brought back several statues like Anubis, and Horus. which children use to make Egyptian scenes. It seems that this civilisation speaks to them particularly. I observe that the making of civilisations is more frequent in elder children but somehow one finds them at all ages. I have one 7-year old girl who repeatedly makes two worlds, one civilised and one fairy/nature world, separated by water. The fairies are often helping the civilised world with food, with celebrations.

# Battles, Black and White Worlds

The dualistic principle of separation and the following of conflicts is an eternal topic in human existence. This is also true for the children playing the World Game, and for some, it is their favourite topic. Generally boys tend to have more battlefields in their boxes than girls.

A typical symbolic way of representing separation or tension is to use only black and white objects. They can be placed opposite each other or all can be white, for example, with one element of black. One child displayed all types of white beings and stones, and in a corner, in a pit in the sand, lurked a dark crocodile. She explained to me that she was unsure whether to put the dark element in or not, but finally she left it in. Frightening elements in varying forms are also used to show the dark side. Sometimes insects such as scorpions, spiders, or animals like snakes and crocodiles are used to threaten, but usually bandits, knights, policemen serve that role.

For some children “the good and bad” is a subject of reflection and discussion within the World Game. For some there is a bit of pleasure in being ‘baddies’, others do not want to be the bad ones.

“Sita does not have the absolute need to have ’baddies’ in her play anymore. When she comes with a friend ‘baddies’ can appear but then she wants her friend to be on her side, and she chooses (also for her friend) not to be on the side of the “baddies”who are the outsiders.” — Journal

# Life Events and Other Events

There are some life events which are clearly major life events and come up very frequently.

## Pregnancy, Birth

This element comes up in very different ways, from animal births, to a newborn baby, to fairy births. One girl explains how the mother faints because it is hard to have a baby. Others prepare gifts for the newborn, or celebrate with magical stones that protect the li le ones.

## Marriage

This element still comes up very often in the classical way with a big celebration, often magical with presents and many people and a special night. But there are also different topics related to it: marrying people who are different, marrying several times or choosing not to marry, or the question of whom to marry. I have not yet come across divorce. One girl explained that marriage has to come, in case a baby needs to be created, one girl did not agree with that and said, laughingly, maybe they can just buy the baby.

## Death

This topic comes up in ba le elds of course, but also in many stories where change is needed or to end a story. Many times afterlife is present, or communication with dead people. Sometimes an animal has died and children represent it in the box. They talk about it .... or not.

## Birthdays, Festivals

Two special events which children love to represent; the approach of their own birthday and Christmas time. The magic of Christmas with snow, a Christmas tree, presents brought by Christmas Father. Their own birthday often starts on waking up with a surprise, presents, friends, etc.

Other events listed below come up frequently, but are not that essential.

## Treasures

Treasures are very often present in the adventure stories, in mysterious ones where a clue has to be found and in archeological research. They are often hidden in the sand, an ideal hiding place. Boxes evoke hidden treasures; sometimes the treasure is a precious crystal or a rare jewel, sometimes it’s hidden inside a statue or in a car, etc.

## Rescue, Protection

Mamas are often protecting the li le ones, for example. I have seen a princess saving a prince (yes), or a dolphin saving a drowning man.

## Light, Fire

Candles appear regularly representing something sacred. The children like to use them. Sometimes they light them themselves, sometimes I help. Once a child asked to make a mini- re in the sand with small sticks from the garden. In one boy’s World Game, the element of light was the center of almost all of his creations:

## Meetings, Gatherings

Those are often present in one form or other. One girl makes a funny World Game where children have serious meetings and adults are playing. Sometimes there is a choir, a picnic, a welcoming event, or an animal gathering.
