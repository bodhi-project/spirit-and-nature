# Approaching creation

> My heart beating fast, my heart bursting out,  
> My heart coming to life,  
> My heart stretching out to give, my heart remembering far away,  
> My heart touched by deep tenderness and love,  
> My heart sighs, my heart fears not, my heart knows the way now,  
> My heart may cry by times, but is not closed,  
>  
> Flying above the ocean, the fish knowing its deep waters,
> Flying with the moon and giving a hug to a known or unknown friend,
> Flying through the galaxy, finding source and being all, Gaia,
> Flying in my dreams and remembering belonging to all, to you Mother,
> Flying to exhaustion and always flying again, wings growing stronger day by day,
> Flying through the night waiting for the Sun to rise,
>  
> When, where, how...?

# Born

> Moving between past, future and present,  
> Alternating joy, pain and silence,  
> Between patience and longing and being,  
> Who am i, what is going to happen, what is happening?  
> All is me...  
> Imaginations, visions, nothing,  
> Words, feelings, pieces of reality,  
> I explode, implode,  
> Reborn, reborn, reborn...  
> With bliss and spasm,  
> With myself, and others...  
> Alive i am this i know.
