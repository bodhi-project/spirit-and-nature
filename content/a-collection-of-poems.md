# Approaching creation

> _My heart beating fast, my heart bursting out,_  
> _My heart coming to life,_  
> _My heart stretching out to give, my heart remembering far away,_  
> _My heart touched by deep tenderness and love,_  
> _My heart sighs, my heart fears not, my heart knows the way now,_  
> _My heart may cry by times, but is not closed,_  
> &nbsp;  
> _Flying above the ocean, the fish knowing its deep waters,_
> _Flying with the moon and giving a hug to a known or unknown friend,_
> _Flying through the galaxy, finding source and being all, Gaia,_
> _Flying in my dreams and remembering belonging to all, to you Mother,_
> _Flying to exhaustion and always flying again, wings growing stronger day by day,_
> _Flying through the night waiting for the Sun to rise,_
>  
> When, where, how...?

# Born

> _Moving between past, future and present,_  
> _Alternating joy, pain and silence,_  
> _Between patience and longing and being,_  
> _Who am i, what is going to happen, what is happening?_  
> _All is me..._  
> _Imaginations, visions, nothing,_  
> _Words, feelings, pieces of reality,_  
> _I explode, implode,_  
> _Reborn, reborn, reborn..._  
> _With bliss and spasm,_  
> _With myself, and others..._  
> _Alive i am this i know._
