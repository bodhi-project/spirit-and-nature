# Anusuya Forest in Auroville

Anusuya is a small forest community in Aurovilleâ€™s greenbelt area and is the home of Spirit and Nature Learning Center. The Greenbelt has been specially designed to protect the city and provide the necessary resources as food and also to as a place to regenerate and relax. The place, called Anusuya, although small and close to the city, has much natural beauty and is still partially wild. It is next to the bigger forest, Samriddhi, and the park area around Gaia.

The land was designated to be a forest at the beginning of Auroville and was first named Anasurya which means without sun. Later on the name changed to Anusuya meaning one who is free from jealousy or envy. In Indian mythology Anusuya was the devoted wife of an ancient Rishi.

## The Forest Now

In this forest you might see varans, turtles, rabbits, mongooses, lizards, snakes (including cobras), scorpios, frogs, many beautiful birds, peacocks every now and then, owls, civet cats, many squirrels and the occasional deer and wild pig. Unauthorised cutting of trees happen by moments and one has to be vigilant, poaching also happen here specially by the gypsies.

## Cyclones

Auroville is in a cyclone-prone zone and many cyclones have crossed these lands. In 2011 we were struck by cyclone Thane and it was the strongest one we've had so far, it was quite devastating. No people were hurt and the main houses were fine. 

# Community

The community where Natures and Spirit is, has 5 houses. Glenn is the steward of the place since 2013 with the help of Christoph and others from the community. Before another neighbour Govinda, an oldtimer, long term Aurovilian from Austria was the steward for many years. Living in the forest demands a dedicated work to maintain the place. Loads of energy to keep up everything through all weathers with simple means and almost no budget. Regularly new indigenous trees and shrubs are planted during the rain seasons.

We have harmonious relations among the 8 inhabitants at this moment. We share a well and windmill and meet informally. Our well is from 1990, and we have only the windmill as water source, with a small pump at about 32 meter deep- 1st aquifer-  It serves the 5 houses and forest. I think we are one of the last communities in Auroville having only a windmill as source of water with no other back up during break downs, or wind still periods. It is challenging by times.

Our well is also miraculous still flowing, as most of the people are having solar or electric pumps at 200 meter depth level, reaching the second and third aquafire. We have only a few solar panels for minimum needs like computer, a few lights, a solar fridge, and occasionally a cold water short wash in a machine.

# The Spirit and Nature Learning Center

The house and forestgarden as it is now was created in 1995 and gradually grew into a vibrant natural space. Before there was a lovely cow farm here called Siddharta farm. But the cows started to eat treebarks, and Herbert, the farmer needed space to grow grains and others. Spirit and Nature donates a small percentage of any profit to the Anusuya forest. I happen to be at the right place at the right time and could settle here, and I have been the caretaker since more than 20 years of a small piece of this community. The work in the forest though started long ago and keeps evolving.

There have been many strong stories around this place, people have lived intense lives. Lots of inner and outer work had to be made and has to be made to have this place stay harmonious. It is also a privilege to have lived here for more than 20 years. What an amazing place.  The foresthouse has been designed by Sigi based on my ideas.
