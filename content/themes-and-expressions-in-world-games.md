# Nature

Natural elements such as trees, gardens, jungles, the sea, beaches, deserts, rivers, stones, plus a variety of animals all seem to have a large place in the children’s creations. 

The natural world is of particular interest to this age group (4 to 11 years), as children are just coming into an extended consciousness of the world whether they are exposed to a lot of nature or not. One tree in the city or a pet mouse can be as appealing as a forest and a farmyard to an individual child. Here in Auroville we are fortunate enough to have an abundance of nature and animals.

It is rare to have a World Game where none of these elements are present. Sometime, mostly among the boys, one observes a solely technical world.

# Civilisation

The next element which we find frequently in the creations are elements of civilisation in the form of houses, cities, villages, farms, castles, fences, people, vehicles, tunnels. Not surprisingly, boats, trains, planes and cars are frequently used by boys.

Pathways come up regularly in differing creative ways: sometimes white marble blocks are used, sometimes glass stones, sometimes a feather, sometimes a large piece of wood. Sometimes a ladder is used to go from one sand tray to another one.

Food items are very often present, too. In the beginning I did not have many things representing food. Once I had a child who simply asked for a fresh carrot and then cut it in small pieces, making tiny carrots. Another time a child wrote on a paper: bread, fruits, etc. Now I have some tasty looking miniature pizza and cakes. Restaurants or picnics can appear and all kind of shops, or shows such as a choir or a circus. The children love perfumes. They often smell deeply into the bottles and some sprinkle it on their hands, or even mix it in the sand. One boy systematically smells the bottles every time he comes.

Objects characteristic of particular ancient civilisations are greatly appreciated. Having traveled to Egypt, I brought back several statues like Anubis, and Horus. which children use to make Egyptian scenes. It seems that this civilisation speaks to them particularly. I observe that the making of civilisations is more frequent in elder children but somehow one finds them at all ages. I have one 7-year old girl who repeatedly makes two worlds, one civilised and one fairy/nature world, separated by water. The fairies are often helping the civilised world with food, with celebrations.

# Battles, Black and White Worlds

The dualistic principle of separation and the following of conflicts is an eternal topic in human existence. This is also true for the children playing the World Game, and for some, it is their favourite topic. Generally boys tend to have more battlefields in their boxes than girls.

A typical symbolic way of representing separation or tension is to use only black and white objects. They can be placed opposite each other or all can be white, for example, with one element of black. One child displayed all types of white beings and stones, and in a corner, in a pit in the sand, lurked a dark crocodile. She explained to me that she was unsure whether to put the dark element in or not, but finally she left it in. Frightening elements in varying forms are also used to show the dark side. Sometimes insects such as scorpions, spiders, or animals like snakes and crocodiles are used to threaten, but usually bandits, knights, policemen serve that role.

For some children “the good and bad” is a subject of reflection and discussion within the World Game. For some there is a bit of pleasure in being ‘baddies’, others do not want to be the bad ones.

“Sita does not have the absolute need to have ’baddies’ in her play anymore. When she comes with a friend ‘baddies’ can appear but then she wants her friend to be on her side, and she chooses (also for her friend) not to be on the side of the “baddies”who are the outsiders.” — Journal

# Life Events and Other Events

There are some life events which are clearly major life events and come up very frequently.

## Pregnancy, Birth

This element comes up in very different ways, from animal births, to a newborn baby, to fairy births. One girl explains how the mother faints because it is hard to have a baby. Others prepare gifts for the newborn, or celebrate with magical stones that protect the li le ones.

## Marriage

This element still comes up very often in the classical way with a big celebration, often magical with presents and many people and a special night. But there are also different topics related to it: marrying people who are different, marrying several times or choosing not to marry, or the question of whom to marry. I have not yet come across divorce. One girl explained that marriage has to come, in case a baby needs to be created, one girl did not agree with that and said, laughingly, maybe they can just buy the baby.

## Death

This topic comes up in ba le elds of course, but also in many stories where change is needed or to end a story. Many times afterlife is present, or communication with dead people. Sometimes an animal has died and children represent it in the box. They talk about it .... or not.

## Birthdays, Festivals

Two special events which children love to represent; the approach of their own birthday and Christmas time. The magic of Christmas with snow, a Christmas tree, presents brought by Christmas Father. Their own birthday often starts on waking up with a surprise, presents, friends, etc.

Other events listed below come up frequently, but are not that essential.

## Treasures

Treasures are very often present in the adventure stories, in mysterious ones where a clue has to be found and in archeological research. They are often hidden in the sand, an ideal hiding place. Boxes evoke hidden treasures; sometimes the treasure is a precious crystal or a rare jewel, sometimes it’s hidden inside a statue or in a car, etc.

## Rescue, Protection

Mamas are often protecting the li le ones, for example. I have seen a princess saving a prince (yes), or a dolphin saving a drowning man.

## Light, Fire

Candles appear regularly representing something sacred. The children like to use them. Sometimes they light them themselves, sometimes I help. Once a child asked to make a mini- re in the sand with small sticks from the garden. In one boy’s World Game, the element of light was the center of almost all of his creations:

## Meetings, Gatherings

Those are often present in one form or other. One girl makes a funny World Game where children have serious meetings and adults are playing. Sometimes there is a choir, a picnic, a welcoming event, or an animal gathering.

# Magical Expressions

Magical elements like fairies, dragons,  rebirds, magic crystals, spells are a common characteristic of this age group.

Fairy stories are de nitely, one of the favorite topics for 8 to 10-year old girls. I enjoyed listening to endless fairy stories.

This is one from Sita: “The green fairy has lived happily some one million years without being married, which is nice because nobody is bossing her around, and she does not need to clean the house, but now she wants to marry and who to marry is the question. She has to travel to a place where magic sand is kept in sacks, with a special shield, which would dissolve the cover (represented by a paper napkin with hearts) where the treasure is kept. This treasure is a crown, and there is also a magic ball coming from the good gods who will say which prince to marry ... “

Sunanda Poddar, who is the Caretaker of “Srismriti”, The Mother’s Museum in Pondicherry, tells us:

I still see this world of fairies. They are the same entities as ‘devas’. They still come to me although I am practicing yoga. Now there is more meaning in them for me. I see them as spirits of the vegetable kingdom — not just as playmates any more. Not only did this world of fairies increase through the Mother but a whole world of beauty, re nement and the realization of her perfection in works was shown. Now I call them ‘beings’ — overseers of the vegetal kingdom.

Madu had disturbed a little arrangement in the box by adding something and Laya complained lightly. Madu laughed and said: “It is not me, it is the fairy.” Then she said: “You know, some people believe their toys are alive.” I said, “Yes, it looks like that, doesn’t it?” Then she tells me about her father’s doll which is always next to her bed, and when she cries the doll is there next to her bed to help her. Then she asks Laya (7 years old) if she believes in fairies. Laya says “Yes, and you?” Madu (almost 9 years old) answers: “Before I believed, but now ...”

Madu seemed to be in transition between believing in magic, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and the phase where the mental takes over.

In the introduction of his book, “Enchantment of the Faerie Realm”, 1996, Ted Andrews says:

When we were children, we knew everything had its own life and energy. The distance between our world and that which we now call ‘imaginary’ was no further than our closet or backyard. Every blade of grass and every  ower had a story to tell. The winds whispered in our ears. Shadows had life, and woods were much more than trees. In our search for the modern life, we no longer see with a child’s eyes, and we sco  and laugh at those who do. In a world of technology and modern conveniences, we have grown insensitive to the nuances of nature. We built boundaries around our lives and shield ourselves from that which we do not understand. Though our lives may seem more safe and secure, they have also lost much wonder and joy.

This feeling that every thing has its own life, seems a very important quality that should be cherished and encouraged. In a world which loses contact with real life, and escapes more and more into virtuality, knowing that a tree is alive and sensitive, that an animal feels and can be happy or sad, that a stone is alive and has a memory, that an object can talk to people and have preferences in how it is handled or where it is disposed, that one can call the rain or ask the rain not to come, that one can send prayers with the birds, is essential to reconnect and save our planet and ourselves from destruction. This can help us grow into a unitive feeling, the One in the all, and the all in the One, into a communion and a truer communication.

# Psychic Expressions

"We give the name ‘psychic’ to the psychological center of our being, the seat within us of the highest truth of our existence, that which can know this truth and set it in movement." - The Mother, “CWM”, Vol 2, p. 12:4

It is beautiful to see the world with the innocence of children, to see the purity of children. Small children often have their psychic more in front, they are more receptive.

Although the World Game relates to all planes of the being, it can especially be a good opportunity to invite and bring forward touches of the psychic dimension. When the mind develops, children can loose this spontaneous receptivity, the innocence.

An environment in which the psychic gets evoked, can help the children to remember their connection to beauty and love.

Many human beings in the world think they know everything, but this world is also like a game, a theater play. The true world is beyond and behind the appearances and not manifested yet.

The Divine has set an evolving play in movement and directs its unfolding for the joy of becoming and progressing eternally.

Here, in Auroville, our game is to build a city with a living soul. The psychic is the secret source of beauty and love.

And in the World Game the children create worlds with endless possibilities, eventually learning to build worlds with harmony, beauty and poetry.

"If you have an artistic or poetic consciousness, if you love harmony, beauty, you will build there something marvelous which will tend to spring up into the material manifestation." - The Mother

All children, wherever they are born, come with a gift which is the purpose of their life and will be revealed.
