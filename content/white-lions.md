# White Lions of Timbavati

The Spirit and Nature Center for Learning has deep links with the White Lion Trust. The White Lion Trust is a public benefit organisation situated in nearly 4,400 acres of endemic bushveld in South Africa. The trust has re-introduced captive-bred white lions into their natural habitat in ground-breaking scientific programs. This is a post about white lions, the danger they face and the work of the White Lion Trust.

The White Lions are a genetic rarity of Panthera Leo and appear in only one place on earth — in the Timbavati and Kruger regions of South Africa. The lions are a critically endangered species and have been on the verge of extinction for the last few decades. The exceptional work of the White Lion Trust has been to restore these animals to their original habitat. 

Right now, there are hundreds of white lions in captivity but less than 13 in the wilds of their endemic habitat.

The story of the white lions is painful — because of their rarity they are prized in zoos and as hunting trophies, and their numbers have come down from thousands to below two dozen. As a direct consequence of six decades of forced removals from their endemic habitat most white lions are now held captive in zoos and circuses worldwide [1].The white lions also carry meaning for the locals and that is what makes their story truly exceptional.

## Canned Hunting

Canned hunting is a form of trophy hunting in which an animal is kept in a confined area, such as in a fenced-in area, and then killed as sport. Such easy slaughter of animals in fenced areas is called "canned hunting" perhaps because it's rather like shooting fish in a barrel. A fully-grown, captive-bred lion is taken from its pen to an enclosed area where it wanders listlessly for some hours before being shot dead by a man with a shotgun, handgun or even a crossbow, standing safely on the back of a truck, for which he pays anything from £5,000 to £25,000, and it is all completely legal. [2]

Canned hunting is a fast-growing business in South Africa, where thousands of lions are being bred on farms to be shot by wealthy foreign trophy-hunters. There are now more lions held in captivity (upwards of 5,000) in the country than living in the wild wild (about 2,000). [3]

Wild populations of lions have declined by 80% in 20 years.

The number of trophy hunted animals is increasing at an alarming rate. From 2001-2006, 1,830 lion trophies were exported from South Africa; and from 2011-2016 about 4,062 were exported — a 122% increase.

In the last few decades the majority of the "demand" was predominantly from the west. Lately, however, propelled by the new-found economic prosperity, Far East is now also in the game. They are not always about the trophies but ask for lion parts for traditional Asian medicine. As a consequence the export of lion bones and whole carcasses has soared. In 2009, five lion skeletons were exported from South Africa to Laos; in 2011, it was 496. [4]

Canned lion hunting has put a price-tag on the head of every wild lion, and this has created a financial incentive for the locals, who collude with poachers or turn a blind eye to the illegal lion kills. Somehow people have reduced the iconic king of the jungle to a commodity, something that can be traded and used.

## The Sacred Dimension

In the Timbavati region of South Africa the native Sepedi and Tsonga communities consider the white lion to be “the most sacred animal on the African continent”. According to traditional wisdom the arrival of these white lions at this particular moment in time and in this particular location is not coincidental.

Zulu shamans and other African elders view the White Lions’ arrival in the wilderness as the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, identifying these majestic creatures as "angelic messengers from God." African elders believe that the White Lions are the most sacred animals on the African continent and are here to deliver a sacred message for humanity during these times of great crisis and transformation.

Though sightings of White Lions were first reported in the 1930s, scientists were unable to document their existence until they were spotted again in the mid 1970s. It is not clear exactly when the White Lions emerged, but by all accounts, this is a recent occurrence, and legend has it that the White Lions have become manifest for a specific spiritual purposes. The name of this area — "Tsimba-vaati” — is derived from the ancient Shangaan language and means “the place where star lions came down from the heavens.”

For many centuries African kings identified the lands of Timbavati as a protected area. It falls on the Nile meridian, a ley line which is also referred to as "Zep Tepi", the spot at which life first emerged on the planet. This area also happens to be exactly aligned with the great Sphinx of ancient Egypt.

Whether one believes in legends and mythologies or not there are many things that cannot be disputed — the coming of these lions in times of crisis was foretold many hundreds of years ago in legends of these people — and that has happened. Many native and traditional African cultures have, and continue, deriving immense meaning from such things.

Editor's note: for those whose interests are piqued in such things — it make for a very interesting study to look at and compare prophecies surrounding the white lions in ancient cultures on other continents.
