At the eve of the 50’th birthday of Auroville, I’m interested in the program of Aikya about abuse of animals and nature in the world inspired by the children. I propose to help them to realise and help them to put in a form by the gestures, the music and the creativity on their expression on the subject. My work with children is centered on self awareness, on opening, the exchange, a dynamic which opens unknown and creative spaces.

I would like to be that facilitator who enables a child to grow in autonomy and responsibility of himself and others in the experimental field of others.

# The Learning Community (TLC)

The Learning Community has been in operation for the last 6 years and at present there are about 50 children enrolled in it. The Learning Community serves as one of the elementary schools in Auroville.

The small informal school is based on the understanding that life and learning are essentially an adventure, and the community at large is a school, TLC acknowledges that Auroville has already acquired a wealth of communicable skills in many fields, and anyone who has skills or enthusiasm to share, is invited to participate in the evolving project. Avoiding the concept of ‘classes’, TLC involves the children into the local environment, while the emphasis on outdoors and physical activities quite literally puts intelligence into the children’s hands. With informal ‘campuses’ spread out over several of Auroville’s communities, TLC is presently attended by about a dozen children in the broad age group of 7 – 14 years.

This vision is well expressed in these excerpts of an interview from Natasha, a founding member of TLC: 

The aim is to create a space where children and adults by living and working together can grow more conscious of their inmost being and learn to know, to perfect and transform their instrument (body, life and mind) into the light of the spirit. We don’t want to create a brilliant student but a living soul. We would like to address the aim of life not as a formal subject but as a latent question inspiring every experience. This is specially important in a time of drastic changes where it is the learners who inherit the future, while the learned usually nd themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists. We would like to create a space where the child especially can keep the sacred, magical feelings and perceptions he has naturally, and invite him to express and explore this sense of connectedness and feeling everything alive. We see Auroville as a place where children and adults have access to a great variety of di erent environments, each having a speci c gift to share. We would like to make a very concrete step towards having Auroville as the learning eld and open the doors of the classrooms into the wider community, using Auroville’s richness and conscious research as our main learning resource. Today we are forced to ask how our educational system can be transformed into one that is truly appropriate for our time. ...How can the children develop skills to deal with complexity and challenges that have never before existed? How can schools that were created for another time meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population of students? In considering these questions, let us look at new possibilities for individuals, learning communities, and an emerging learning society. It is important to see that our differences connect.
