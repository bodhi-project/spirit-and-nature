# The forest is a mysterious place

Anusuya forest was once a vast, open, barren land where nothing grew but now it is a green forest!

Anusuya is a small forest community in Auroville’s greenbelt area and is the home of Spirit and Nature Learning Center. The place, called Anusuya, although small and close to the so called city, has much natural beauty and is still partially wild. We are living off grid, we have only a few solar panels for minimum needs, and an old windmill with a small well only reaching the first aquifire.

In this forest you might see varans, turtles, rabbits, mongooses, lizards, snakes (including cobras), scorpios, frogs, many beautiful birds, peacocks every now and then, owls, civet cats, many squirrels and the occasional deer and wild pig.

In 2011 we were struck by cyclone Thane and it was the strongest one we've had so far, it was quite devastating. No people were hurt and the main houses were fine. 

Living in the forest demands a dedicated work of care through all weathers with often very simple means. Beside planting, cleaning, protecting, planning, maintaining, there is also the joy of consciously connecting to all.

# And sometimes kids come to the forest…

Here five girls made a mysterious wild horse - symbol of true power. Even with rains the beautiful horse stayed strong in the middle of the mysterious forest…
