# World games in Nature

We will learn about animals and flowers mainly but we will also learn how to express beautifully. Beauty for me is a thing that is as important as any other value in the world. I especially like natural beauty with the touch of tomorrow — something new with ancient roots. But actually each of us has his special style which is no one else’s. This is important not to forget. Always remember when you meet any living being because each one is unique. Plants are more group bound. Animals too have a collective consciousness, they live connected to each other through the great spirit.

# A Typical Session

Eden, a ten-year old boy, arrives at my house on his little cycle. He greets the dog Sati who is always excited to see a child arriving. Eden knows him. He picks up a stick in the garden and starts playing with the dog as he moves towards the house. Very often Eden notices something in the garden: a new flower that has bloomed, a special butterfly, a little bird’s nest. Then he enters the room and his eyes light up at seeing all the objects displayed on shelves and in many little baskets. Straight away he looks for his favourite figurines, some knights, or some play mobil, and places them in the container filled with sand. I choose music which I feel fits the mood, sit down quietly and observe. Eden relates a story of what happened at school during the week, while looking for the next objects to choose to create his little world of today. He grows silent while concentrating on making his very particular small world, filled with magical elements. He tells me a little about his world as he creates it. His story is spread out in the sand.

With the World Game in Auroville, we offer an opportunity to be creative, to be able to express our own individuality and our unique, living soul.

“The chief aim of education should be to help the growing soul to draw out that in itself which is best and make it perfect for a noble use.” — Sri Aurobindo and The Mother, “On Education”, p.21

Children are invited to be true to themselves, to get in touch with and express their deeper dreams. Indeed, it may be a way to change the world if we believe that the dreams of children today are the realities of tomorrow.

# The attitude of the Facilitator

As young children learn to be who they are, they start to grow as individuals. It is important for them to express their creativity, and later as growing adults it will eventually deepen. The main role of the facilitator is to enhance the creative moments and to support the children in bringing them forward. The environment is important - there is a presence, a stillness, a beauty in the room and garden that helps in coming to a quiet space in oneself, and this is the case for the facilitator and for the child.

The attitude of the facilitator is non-judgmental and so no interpretation is given. To interpret rightly requires deep knowledge. Symbols can also be very subjective and have many layers, especially in the variety of cultures of Auroville. Sometimes the particular creation is also just a mood, the expression of a moment. To enclose a person in a labeled box would be limiting, closing opportunities for growth.

Facilitators should try to be subtle, identified with peace and vastness. They should observe, and try to find harmony. They should try to be centred, and bring awareness of their actions and to the actions of the children in handling objects, plus an awareness to all that is happening. The role of facilitators is to be present in the moment, inwardly and outwardly, simple, giving, open, equal, concentrated, able to go deep into the child’s inner world and finally be able to communicate through the psychic. The more the facilitators are conscious, the be er it will be for the children.

How to do that? Follow your own imagination, your roots, since it is always about honoring who you truly are right now, creating intention, doing whatever is needed to energize that sacred space within yourself.

“In order to find the soul you must go in this way (gesture of going deep) like this back from the surface withdrawn deep within and enter, enter, enter, go down, down, down into a very deep hole, silent, immobile there, there’s a kind of something warm, quiet, rich in substance and very still, like a sweetness - That’s the soul.”

— Selections from the works of The Mother, “The Psychic Being”, p.191

The sacred state in which we are renewed and in contact with the deep truth of our existence can come through deep relaxation. The World Game can bring or encourage relaxation through the peaceful and natural environment, the free space to create. Special skills are not required to play the World Game. One doesn’t have to speak, but may, and generally there is no time pressure.

# Documenting the World Game

It can be interesting to document the work of the children in the World Game, so that we can observe development over time. We do not document to find progress, but rather to find processes or development over time, and we always try to do this without judgment.

The facilitator fills out a diagram of the child’s expression including what pieces she/he uses, in what order they are placed and if any were moved or removed. Any other remarks are welcome as are stories told by the child. Another possibility is to make case studies if a child comes on a regular basis.

In this manner one can make more precise notes of the sessions including the major themes, figures used and even the relationship between child and facilitator. We can take photographs after each session which help when we look back at a child’s evolution or when we want to write a book. Or we can make a portfolio for each child as a gift. And you can lm during the play.

“Mostly children notice that I make pictures or movies, but it seems as if they have integrated this as part of the session and simply forget about it.” — Journal

Children like to look back at pictures and often express great joy especially when seeing movies. They also ask sometimes to see the work of other children. In the beginning of the World Game I ask if pictures can be shown to others. Mostly children love to share and agree.

Parents sometimes ask to see the documentation and they bring a Memory Stick to copy it. I keep the pictures on my laptop. But overall we do not really speak about the children’s creation in the sandbox, we give no instructions for the topic and most of the time give no comments on the result, which gives the maximum space for free expression. Sometimes I give encouragement or correct something, but I do not want to manipulate. They choose their own path.

# Practical Aspects of the World Games

I have been facilitating the World Game for over eight years with one interrupted year, and in that time there have been more than fifty players. It has varied according to how many came each year, and how many came more than once. To a end regularly means an average of six sessions per year although a few might have come twenty times a year. And, others less.

I take children individually or in pairs and occasionally a group of three at a time. When the children come in two’s (or more) it is mostly co-operative fantasy play, where each of the players stimulates the other. In some cases we see parallel play where children do not truly interact. This is more rare in the age group with which I usually work (6 to 12 years old).

The children’s rhythm while playing is sometimes slow and silent or sometimes interactive, with lots of laughter.

## HOW OLD ARE THE CHILDREN? HOW MANY COME AT ONCE?

Anyone who wishes may come. Mainly children are above 5 or 6 years old but younger than 13. Generally after 5 or 6, their motor skills are more developed, which is necessary to handle the many delicate objects.

One or two children, occasionally more, are invited at one time in my set-up for the moment. The number can be increased on special request.

The one-to-one sessions always offer a special flavor and a sense of exclusive time. There is an agreement with the teachers that children who come only now and then can miss a regular class to do so.

Aside from children, some adults come. They make a symbolic representation of an aspect of their life. There is not a real story attached to it, except the story of the representation itself.

## TIME SPAN OF SESSIONS, FREQUENCY OF SESSIONS

The first time I take a child I usually allow for a one-hour session to see if the child is at ease, whether the time will be right, not too long, not too short and whether the child can enter the play. Usually I ask the parent not to stay around so that the child feels uninhibited, free. After the session I may ask the child if he feels he might need more time the next time and then plan accordingly for the next session.

Very often it varies between one hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half. This has to be reviewed frequently as needs change. Children often become engrossed in their story; I feel it is fair to remind them of the time limit about 10 minutes before the end of the session. I try not to forget to tell them (if I’m not taken by their creative play myself) that soon they will have to leave, so it’s time for them to think about an ending.

I experimented working without a time limit when it was possible for the child (and for me) to stay as long as needed. With some children that works very well, in the sense that it is balanced. With some children I need to place a clear limit.

Usually a monthly session is recommended but if there is a special need, the child can come weekly for a while. A single session is also fine. You could plan it, for example, on the child’s birthday. It is a nice way to reflect without analysing on that special ‘birth’ day. The Mother speaks about the “birth” day as a day where one is especially close to one’s soul. In the future I would like to have an open time with the children where different activities can take place.

## EXAMPLES OF HOW CHILDREN PLAY

They make a scene silently and then at the end they tell a story spontaneously, or wait for an invitation to talk about it.
The children tell a story as they create - mostly the younger children - and the story keeps evolving and changing over the session (or even over several sessions).
There is a story told just by the placement of the objects without words, and after that an interactive story starts with the other objects or with a partner, on another level without changing the created world, just moving objects around as in a one-act theatre scene.
The child proceeds silently and has nothing to add verbally.
A story has been thought about earlier and is depicted very precisely or is written down precisely after having been depicted.

## THE MATERIALS

### CONTAINERS

The size of the sand tray by European standards is 28.5 inches x 22.5 inches x 3 inches. This size is considered ideal to keep an overview while playing, but many people make variations in size. One can use two kinds of trays: one tray with dry sand and the other moist sand. Dry and wet sand are different mediums and allow for different types of expression. Originally, the trays were painted blue on the inside. The blue on the sides can represent the sky, and the blue on the bottom can represent water – a lake, a river or the sea. In the West the trays are usually on a table, but as we are in India I place the container at ground level.

I have been experimenting with different containers for the sand, first a very small one, then a large hexagram. I also used an old suitcase covered with cloth, and now I have the classic one, and a square one with mirrors on the sides. Later it would be interesting to introduce, in a small garden area, a naturally shaped container and also a small, shallow water body. It would also be interesting to experiment with a greater variety of containers (circular, rectangular, hexagonal) in different colors, allowing the children to choose. Basically I would encourage you to try with what you have at hand.

Once I acquired the two new boxes the children asked for both, especially when more than one child came at the same time. Together they used both boxes to elaborate the scene, or they made their scenes individually.

### SAND

Up to this time I have been using refined sand from local places. I have heard about chinchilla sand which might be a very soft kind of sand, and about moon sand which would enable children to make sculptures easily. Someone told me about coral sand from Lakshwadeep and black sand from Hawaii, but I’ve never tried. The sand particles, created by the disintegration of the earth’s rocks, are ideal for pouring and shaping an image of the symbolic world.

### FIGURINES, OBJECTS

Objects and figurines are attractively and playfully displayed on shelves and in baskets. These figures, from various cultures and from nature, symbolise events and situations in our inner and outer lives. We basically need a collection of objects representing everything belonging to our world, such as:

Realistic objects: figurines, miniature animals, trees, instruments, houses, vehicles
Cultural objects: reproductions of statues and other objects coming from known civilisations of the past and the present
Supernatural, imaginary beings: fairies, dragons, unicorns, gnomes
Artificial objects: rods, spheres, plates, geometric shapes
Symbols: aum, star, coins, totems
Natural materials: rocks, stones, seeds, pieces of wood, shells, feathers, crystals, pieces of cloth and paper
All vocations, professions, crafts, endeavours and industries and their tools can be represented. Bizarre things should be included which can be used in different ways, for instance springs or a broken hair-clip. Children also especially cherish boxes of all types and sizes.

Children sometimes give clues for what to add, as in the following example:

“One day as I was looking into what children would need the most right now in terms of objects, a 13-year old girl suggested that I find more figurines expressing emotions clearly, such as happy or sad, etc. It was not so easy to find such figurines. You may think that small children are not so particular about the exact expressions of figurines or the quality of the material in which they are made, but that is not the case.” — Journal

“Yam comments on the black Knight: “He is almost good, only not the expression on his face.” Some children love Playmobil because they have not played much with them, they are not easily available in India. They like to combine, and make what they wish to represent. Other children, like Jalin, do not want to use Playmobiles as they do not look real. Jalin is preoccupied with the need to have everything correct, as much as possible, how it really was at that time in Egypt. For example, as there was no plastic then, no plastic figurines can be used ...it shows how seriously he takes it all!” — Journal

The sizes of the objects, for example houses, people, trees, etc. are often not in the same proportion to each other as we are used seeing around us. Some children are particular about this, but many do not seem to mind having different sizes like a small house and a big person, or a big bird and a small elephant.

“Madu says: “What I like about Sandbox, is that when you look for something in particular you find exactly what you need.”” — Journal

### DISLAY OF OBJECTS

In the classical approach to the sandbox, objects are generally displayed on open shelves where each object is clearly visible and accessible for the child. I use lots of little baskets which I cover with a nice cloth to store objects by categories, like big animals, small ones, stones, flowers/greenery, etc. On one of my voyages to Indonesia I found some lovely baskets which t one into the other, and which have nice square shapes with lids.

Another way of grouping the miniatures is by developmental level, which means that the items a child may be likely to choose are placed at the child’s height. A third way would be archetypal grouping, for example all earth elements such as stones placed at ground level, while religious figures are on higher shelves.

Follow your own preference for display according to the possibilities and your own inclination for the order of things. Sometimes the children who come may give you suggestions or you might see that certain things are not on the right level or are never used because they are not visible. Change the place of things occasionally and see if they are then chosen. I also have a shelf where I display new things.

The children love to unearth objects in the mixed baskets, like a discovery in an attic full of junk or treasures buried in the sand.

Stealing is a problem which occurs from time to time and can be anticipated. For me it is important to speak about this with the children as the topic comes up. With these young children we have an opportunity to make it clear, without over-reacting, that stealing is not acceptable. Sometimes they have their own ideas about it as in this example:

“One boy has a large collection of Playmobil toys at home. He speaks about his experience with some of his friends stealing some small things in his home and how he carefully looks and makes traps ...he also says now that he knows how it is when others steal from him; he feels he cannot take from others anymore. Before he was tempted (or did) at times.” — Journal

“Today Sita asked to borrow some Christmas trees, so I thought (but have not yet said anything) to introduce this idea of borrowing, to avoid the temptation of stealing.” — Journal

### REPAIR OF OBJECTS

Children are children and each child has different ways of handling things, due to their education, their motor skills, their concentration level and their age. It is inevitable that things break. I feel objects often as alive and feel bad if things are handled improperly; I convey this to children while asking them to take care how they handle the little things, in an implicit or explicit way.

# Outcome

By engaging in this activity, the child creates his own world and becomes aware of his creative potential. It enhances the power of imagination and permits conscious dreaming.
Of course, the child is free to express whatever is in him and if necessary he goes through chaos and disharmony. But, according to me, it is important to come to some kind of harmony towards the end of the session, or after a series of sessions.
Through the atmosphere in the room – decoration, music, flowers, candle, incense and preferably a peaceful aspiring attitude of the facilitator – and through the choice of quality and beauty in the objects, the child is invited to be true to himself and is given the possibility to come in touch with and express his deeper dreams. These deeper dreams are often hiding in this little place behind the heart which one calls soul and which is joy, peace, light in a seed form and gradually grows into a soul being. Also here, the guide is an example and it is important that he/she is concentrated in his/her luminous centre and acts as much as possible from here.
Through spontaneous role plays and verbal expression, communication skills develop.
The atmosphere of the place and the emotional workout through the play brings relaxation in the body and an inner harmony, which increases the body’s receptivity and the capacity of the mind to pay attention.
Aspiration and sensitivity for beauty also develops and beauty is the ideal which all physical life must realise. If you have an artistic or poetic consciousness, if you love harmony, beauty, you will build there something marvellous which will tend to spring up into the material manifestation.

“When one is very young [...] there is always, in the dreams of the child, a kind of aspiration, which for the child’s consciousness is a sort of ambition, for something which would be beauty without ugliness, justice without injustice, goodness without limits, and a conscious, constant success, a perpetual miracle. Children should be taught, [...] this is what should guide your life, organise it, make you develop in the direction of the true reality which the ordinary world calls illusion.” — The Mother

Dora Kalff, the originator of Sandplay Therapy, once told that she “did nothing” when she worked. Then she said, “It is harder to do nothing than to do something.” How can one do “nothing” during the time of a play session? What happens in the sacred space shared by the therapist and the client, during a Sandplay process? 

One might believe that she meant that the healing work she did came not from an ego state, but from her relationship with the Self and the collective unconscious and it is hard to put the ego on hold and do nothing.

The facilitator serves as a midwife for the images of the invited player, by receiving them just as they are, allowing them their own pace for emerging into the outer world. 

Whether the makers of these sand creations are children, healers, or priests, potent and ineffable energies can be stirred on an intuitive, non-rational level. Sand opens the door to the unconscious world. In western European folklore, the sandman puts children to sleep by sprinkling sand into their eyes. Sand is impressionable, mutable, and impermanent:

“Dancing on sands, and yet no footing seen,” Shakespeare. 

The sand particles, created by the disintegration of the earth’s rocks, are ideal for pouring and shaping an image of the symbolic world. We can “[...] see a World in a grain of Sand” as Blake wrote.
