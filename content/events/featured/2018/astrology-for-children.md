In collaboration with Auromira who introduced the kids to science related to the planets, and with Maurice, professional astrologer.

Children learned about the influence of the planets, notions of astronomy, relating it  to their personal birthday,sun and moon sign, relating it to the 4 elements, the symbol, the planets. They went into the garden finding natural materials illustrating the activity.

It is important to remember that the universe is alive and changes positions all the time. Each planet being a living entity with it's precise influence. Although one has to be genius or an accomplished yogi to know the whole picture, it is fun to start to make connections....and unravel mysteries. Sri Aurobindo says: 'it is impossible to manifacture a perfect astrologer by education as to manifacture a poet'.

Maurice writes: Introducing the incredibly wise kids of Auroville to astrology was lots of fun (and not so obvious)... so, not making this up: the Pisces wants to be a diver, the Taurus wants to be a baker, the Aquarian wants to be an actor or a scientist of space, the other Aquarian wants to be a computer You-Tube gamer, the Cancer wants to be a chef, the Sag wants to be a scientist to save the planet... There ya go! Ready now for the year of the Dog!
