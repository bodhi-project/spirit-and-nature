# What it is

One United Roar was a campaign to give lions and wildlife a voice, it was a call to action and a call to arms - but celebration not warfare is the weapon of disarmament.

There is an African proverb that says: "Until the lion learns to speak, the story will always be told from the hunters perspective”. Unfortunately there has been a surge in the sale of lion bones for "medicinal" purposes and the White Lions are under threat of being poached for those.

Launched on 22 August 2016 in the month of Leo, to commemorate CECIL, the Zimbabwean Lion whose brutal killing in 2015 by an American tourist ignited the hearts of millions, the One United Roar Talent Challenge invited Lion Hearted children of the world to speak for the lions.

# How Nature and Spirit is a part of it

Hundreds of children around the world roared their heart out for nature and the lions. This campaign was introduced to children in Auroville and 12 participated. All were winners and 2 of our kids, Yam and Asia were among the 6 International participants who won a trip to the Heartlands of the White Lions in South Africa with one of their parents at the end of March 2017.  Their dream came true!

“I gave my whole heart to filming them and making the edits. In a way these kids and this campaign propelled me towards applying for a scholarship to the Academy some months later.” - From Aikya’s Journal

# Conclusion

“If we don’t shift our paradigm, lions will be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes”.

One United Roar offered our children from Auorivlle an incredible opportunity to learn about what is happening to wildlife in Africa - and White Lions in particular - in the world at this moment; it gave them the chance to learn about the sacredness of all life and to make a positive impact through their participation.
