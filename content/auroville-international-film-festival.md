# Auroville Film Festival 2017

Five movies which were made for the ‘One United Roar’ International talent challenge made by Aurovilian  TLC kids were submitted for the AVFF.

Yam’s movie won a beautiful award. You can watch it online.

Open Your Eyes

- 2017, India, 4 min, English
- Director and Producer: Aran Yardeni
- Script: Yam Yardeni, Aran Yardeni
- Watch online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcNM4GcM3ts
- Jury: “This film is a mature attempt to bring our attention to the beauty that surrounds us which we take for granted. The film urges us to be a part of such activity which will nurture human understanding about our world exponentially. The film also makes a poignant statement about the danger of losing the nature and beauty around us, if we do not appreciate and act to preserve them.”

I also submitted my small movie called ‘A dream comes true’ and got encouragements from my friends.
