# Auroville Film Festival 2017

Five movies which were made for the ‘One United Roar’ International talent challenge made by Aurovilian TLC kids were submitted for the (AVFF)[http://filmfestival.auroville.org/]. Yam’s movie won a beautiful award.

Jury: “_This film is a mature attempt to bring our attention to the beauty that surrounds us which we take for granted. The film urges us to be a part of such activity which will nurture human understanding about our world exponentially. The film also makes a poignant statement about the danger of losing the nature and beauty around us, if we do not appreciate and act to preserve them._”
