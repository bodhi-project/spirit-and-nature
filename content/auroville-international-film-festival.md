# Auroville Film Festival 2017

![AIFF #1](/content-assets/aiff/posters_646X605.jpg)

Five movies were submitted to the [Auroville International Film Festival](http://filmfestival.auroville.org/) and Yam’s movie won a beautiful award. [You can watch it online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcNM4GcM3ts).

Jury: “_This film is a mature attempt to bring our attention to the beauty that surrounds us which we take for granted. The film urges us to be a part of such activity which will nurture human understanding about our world exponentially. The film also makes a poignant statement about the danger of losing the nature and beauty around us, if we do not appreciate and act to preserve them._”

Originally these clips were made for the ‘One United Roar’ International talent challenge by Aurovilian TLC kids. [You can watch these clips here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypjc5E-sfqU&list=PLvSMhwXjvCq9xaw13X1o1x9-E8OAN_Fu2).

I also submitted my small movie called ‘A Dream Comes True’. [You can also see this movie online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcNM4GcM3ts).
