# About Me

![About #1](/content-assets/about/about1_850X490.jpg)

Aikya is a trained psychologist and is the founder of ‘Nature and Spirit’ in Auroville. She has always been searching for her true purpose in life — of finding oneness, consciousness and beauty — or the way of Creative Shakti. Aikya enjoys working with children as they are still close to their heart and with people who are open to exploring new territories.
